# DiscordStorageBot

A proof-of-concept project that uses Discord (or any text-based platform) to store files and provide a FTP server with live access to it.

See: https://github.com/Guichaguri/MinimalFTP

You may (in fact, definitely) need to disable the timout function of your FTP client as this thing is as slow as it can get.
